This is a project from The Odin Project to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript.

One of the requirement was to accept case insensitive input(s) from users(for example, roCk, PaPER, ScISsOrS). I acheieved that by converting the user's input to all lowercase characters before the function utilize the parameter from the user. 

I have also added a valid input checker into the game function using an if conditional statement.
